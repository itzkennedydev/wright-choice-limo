    quote: "Who expects to receive an ice cold bottle of water at your left hand when you get into a chartered car? Who expects to laugh when the traffic gets unbearable? If you don't expect it, it is a delightful surprise. If you do expect it, you are probably using Wright Choice Livery. I was surprised, but I am definitely going to be a loyal client of theirs. Ron Jr. really is someone I trust, will rely on, and will call upon when my travels require a trip to the airport, or a trip to the dentist for surgery. I am glad they are there for us.",
